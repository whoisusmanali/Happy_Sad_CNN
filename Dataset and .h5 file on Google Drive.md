# Happy_Sad_CNN
In this project I download the dataset from Google Chrome Extension to download all the images on one page. Further I preprocessed the data and Build a CNN model with 88% accuracy and predict the result. Lastly, save the file into .h5 format for later use which is also attached in this Repository.


Follow the following link to access the dataset and .h5 file:
